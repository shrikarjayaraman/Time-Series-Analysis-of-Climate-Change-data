# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Climate-Change-data
Part of the Project component for the course CSE3506-Essesntials Of Data Analytics.


Using the Berkeley Climate Change Dataset we will analyze the components of the time series data and then using the inferences build a forecasting model to predict the future temperatures of India
We will be using 2 models for this
ARIMA - Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average
Prophet - Facebook's Forecasting model.

We will then compare the Forecast results to actual recorded temperatures to test the accuracies of both the models
